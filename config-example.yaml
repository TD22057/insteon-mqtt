# Insteon <-> MQTT bridge configuration file.
#
# THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE FILE!
#
# At minimum, you need to make the following edits to use this as your
# config file:
# 1. Set the Modem port (or if using a hub hub_ip, hub_user, hub_password)
# 2. Remove the example devices
# 3. Add your insteon devices
# 4. Confirm your MQTT broker settings
#
# NOTE: the loader supports using a !include tag to load other as a
# item entry so you can do things like this:
#
# insteon:
#    devices: !include devices.yaml
#
# Your config settings will be applied over the base settings.  Any setting
# you do not define, will use the base values.  You can view the base config
# in insteon_mqtt/data/config-base.yaml

  ### Discovery Settings
  #
  # Home Assistant implements mqtt device discovery as outlined at:
  # https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery
  # if discover_topic_base is defined, devices (as defined in config.yaml)
  # announce themselves to Home Assistant. Announcing occurs once
  # upon startup of insteon-mqtt and whenever HomeAssistant restart.
  #
  # The details of discovery_entities and how to define your own discovery
  # templates can be found here:
  # https://github.com/TD22057/insteon-mqtt/blob/master/docs/discovery.md
  #
  # Any additional variables that a specific device may offer are documented
  # in the comments below under that device class.
  #
  # TO ENABLE THE DISCOVERY PLATFORM: Set the following to true
  enable_discovery: false
