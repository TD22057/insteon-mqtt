# Quick Start for Home Assistant users

## Prerequisites

These instructions assume that you:

- Have a Home Assistant installation with Home Assistant __Supervisor__ up and
  running.  Installing using the instructions in the Home Assistant
  [Getting Started Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/)
  or the slightly more advanced
  [Recommened Installation Methods](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/#recommended)
  will work.  The advanced
  [Home Assistant Supervised](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer)
  installation should also work as well.

- Have a working MQTT broker up and running.
  [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is good choice, and there is [an add-on
  for Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/mosquitto/) that
  makes installation simple.

- Have an Insteon PLM modem (serial or USB) or an Insteon HUB on a fixed IP
  address.

## Installation

1. Navigate in Home Assistant frontend to __Supervisor -> Add-on Store__
2. Select the menu in the top right and click __Repositories__
3. Paste the following URL into the __Add Repository__ field:
   `https://github.com/TD22057/insteon-mqtt`
4. Click __ADD__
5. Scroll to find the __Insteon MQTT Repository__
6. Click on the __Insteon MQTT__ Add on
7. Click __Install__
8. Click __Start__ to start the Add-on, this will create your initial config
   files.
9. Edit `/config/insteon-mqtt/config.yaml` as appropriate. See [configuration](configuration.md) for detailed instructions.
10. Enable the [Discovery Platform](discovery.md)

> Alternatively, if you choose to define your entities in Home Assistant
> manually instead of using the Discovery Platform, see [Home Assistant yaml
  config](HA_yaml_config.md)

11. Restart the insteon-mqtt addon to pick up the changes to the `config.yaml` file.
12. If you navigate in Home Assistant to __Configuration -> Integrations -> MQTT__ you should see your devices and entities.
13. Initialize your devices as discussed in [initializing](initializing.md).
14. See the [device documentation](mqtt.md) for additional commands.

## Backing up your Data

The default settings in the config.yaml file will save all user data to the
`/config/insteon-mqtt` directory.  So you only need to backup and save this
data, you do not need to make a snapshot of the Insteon-MQTT add-on.  This
directory may also contain a log file if you have enabled logging,
be careful, this can get quite large.

## Updating

Check the supervisor page periodically for updates to Insteon-MQTT
