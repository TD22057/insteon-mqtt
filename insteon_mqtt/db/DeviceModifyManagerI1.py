class DeviceModifyManagerI1:
    """Manager for modifying the link database of an i1 device.

       To maninpulate the all link database from an old i1 device, we have to
       send a series of requests.  All of these requests are standard length
       requests so the data payload is limited to 1 byte.  Since links are 8
       bytes this takes a while.  First we have to tell the device the most
       significant bit (MSB) of the address we want to start scanning from (0F
       in our case).  Then we have to peek and poke each least significant bit
       (LSB) byte into place.

       Because the data payload is only 1 byte, this gets stupid fast.  First,
       we have to peek the least significant byte.  The device then responds
       with a peel response message that contains the byte at that location,
       but not the address of the byte. So we have to track the state of the
       requests that we send, and if we are careful with how agressively we
       send our requests, we can be relatively certain that a response received
       is a response to the most recently sent message.

       Second, in order to write to that address, we poke a single byte back to
       the device.  This request lacks any details about the address, instead
       the device writes the data to the last peeked byte.  The device responds
       with an ack containing the value of the poked byte.

       This is a fragile process, amazingly it works most of the time.
       However, this can and will subtly fail at time.  In some instances,
       there is no indication of the failure other than an improperly written
       link on the device.

       This class is initialized with the full entry to write to the device
       and handles the management of sending the necessary commands to write
       the link to the device.  The class only writes the bytes that need to be
       changed.
