class DeviceScanManagerI1:
    """Manager for scaning the link database of an i1 device.

       To download the all link database from an old i1 device, we have to send
       a series of requests.  All of these requests are standard length
       requests so the data payload is limited to 1 byte.  Since links are 8
       bytes this takes a while.  First we have to tell the device the most
       significant bit (MSB) of the address we want to start scanning from (0F
       in our case).  Then we have to request each least significant bit (LSB)
       to get the full link we do this using the peek command.

       Because the data payload is only 1 byte, there is no room for the
       "state" of the response message, meaning we will receive a single byte
       from the device, but the message will not have the address of the byte.
       So we have to track the state of the requests that we send, and if we
       are careful with how agressively we send our requests, we can be
       relatively certain that a response received is a response to the most
       recently sent message.  However, this can and will subtly fail at time.

       We detect the last message by parsing the full link data returned and
       looking for the high_water bit in the link record.

       This class will cache all of the bytes received until a full link record
       has been received, at which point it will pass the record onto the db
       handler.
