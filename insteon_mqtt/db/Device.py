    This class stores the all link database for an Insteon device.  Each item
    is a DeviceEntry object that contains a single remote address, group, and

    db is constructed via message.InpExtended objects being read and parsed
    after requesting them from the device.

    Insteon devices use a "delta" to record the revision of the database on

        Insteon devices are each assigned to a broad device category.
        Individual devices each then have a subcategory.  See the catalog.py
        module for details.

        Within the broad device category, insteon devices are assigned to a
        more narrow sub category.  Generally a sub-category remains
        consistent throughout a single model number of a a product, however
        not always.  Smart Labs has done a poor job of publishing the details
        of the sub-categories.  Some resources for determining the details of
        a sub-category are:

        http://cache.insteon.com/pdf/INSTEON_DevCats_and_Product_Keys_20081008.pdf
        http://madreporite.com/insteon/Insteon_device_list.htm

        Generally knowing the dev_Cat and sub_Cat is sufficient for
        determining the features that are available on a device.
        Additionally knowing the engine version of the device is also another
        good indicator.

        The firmware version of a device is just that, the version number of
        the embedded code on the device.  In theory, this firmware is
        updatable (although not by a casual user), however Smart Labs has
        never published an update for any device.

        That said, it does seem that Smart Labs routinely updates the
        firmware that is installed on devices before they are sold.  However,
        Smart Labs does not publish changelogs, nor does it discuss what
        changes have been made.  Based on anecdotal evidence, few if any
        changes in firmware have added any features to a device.
