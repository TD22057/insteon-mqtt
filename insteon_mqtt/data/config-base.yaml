  ### Discovery Settings
  #
  # Home Assistant implements mqtt device discovery as outlined at:
  # https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery
  # if discover_topic_base is defined, devices (as defined in config.yaml)
  # announce themselves to Home Assistant. Announcing occurs once
  # upon startup of insteon-mqtt and whenever HomeAssistant restart.
  #
  # The details of discovery_entities and how to define your own discovery
  # templates can be found here:
  # https://github.com/TD22057/insteon-mqtt/blob/master/docs/discovery.md
  #
  # Any additional variables that a specific device may offer are documented
  # in the comments below under that device class.
  #
  # TO ENABLE THE DISCOVERY PLATFORM: Set the following to true
  enable_discovery: false

  # This defines the base topic for publishing discovery messages, likely
  # does not need to be changed unless you changed your setting in
  # HomeAssistant
  discovery_topic_base: 'homeassistant'

  # The mqtt topic to monitor for HomeAssistant status.  This likely doesn't
  # need to be changed unless you have altered it.  When the message 'online'
  # is received on this topic, InsteonMQTT will publish the discovery
  # entities.  See https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/birth_will/
  discovery_ha_status: 'homeassistant/status'

  # This is a variable that is available for use in all templates, as
  # {{device_info_template}}.  It is envisioned that it would be used to set
  # the device map information, see e.g.
  # https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch.mqtt/#device
  # While the identifiers or (ids) section is listed as optional, it has been
  # my experience that it is required.
