    TODO: docs

    Sample configuration input:

        insteon:
          devices:
            - mini_remote4:
              name: "Remote A"
              address: 44.a3.79

            - mini_remote8:
              name: "Remote B"
              address: 44.a3.80

    The issue with a battery powered remotes is that we can't download
    the link database without the remote being on.  You can trigger
    the remote manually and then quickly send an MQTT command with the
    payload 'getdb' to download the database.  We also can't test to
    see if the local database is current or what the current motion
    state is - we can really only respond to the remote when it sends
    out a message.

    The Signal Switch.signal_active will be emitted whenever
    the device button is pushed.

    The run_command() method is used for arbitrary remote commanding
    (via MQTT for example).  The input is a dict (or keyword args)
    containing a 'cmd' key with the value as the command name and any
    additional arguments needed for the command as other key/value
    pairs. Valid commands for all devices are:

       getdb:    No arguments.  Download the PLM modem all link database
                 and save it to file.
       refresh:  No arguments.  Ping the device to get the current state and
                 see if the database is current.  Reloads the modem database
                 if needed.  This will emit the current state as a signal.
