class IOLinc(Base):
    """Insteon IOLinc relay/sensor device.

    This class can be used to model the IOLinc device which has a sensor and
    a relay.  Unfortunately, it behaves very poorly.  Unlike every other
    device, it doesn't broadcast the relay and sensor on separate groups.  So
    messages arrive from either and commands are for the relay.  There a
    number of internal mode state which change how the device behaves (see
    below for details).

    NOTE: DO NOT USE THE SET BUTTON ON THE DEVICE TO CONTROL THE DEVICE. This
    will confuse the code and will cause the representation of the sensor
    and relay states to get our of whack.  It will also cause devices which are
    linked to the sensor to react when in fact the sensor has not tripped.
    This can be fixed by running refresh which always updates both the sensor
    and relay.

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_on_off( Device, bool sensor_is_on, bool relay_is_on,
                     on_off.Mode mode ):
      Sent whenever the sensor is turned on or off.

    NOTES:
      - Broadcast messages from the device always* describe the state of the
        device sensor.
      - Commands sent to the device always affect the state of the relay.
      - Using the On/Off/Set commands will always cause the relay to change
        to the requested state.  The device will ignore any Momentary_A or
        Momentary_C requirements about the type of command or the state of the
        sensor.  Similarly the relay will still trip even if relay_linked is
        enabled and the sensor has not tripped.  The momentary_secs length is
        still respected and the relay will return to the off position after
        the requisite length of time. The code will accururately track the
        state of the relay and sensor following these commands.
      - Controlling the IOLinc from another device or a modem scene works
        as Insteon intended.

    Note about Momentary_C:
        If the IOLinc is in Momentary_C mode and a command
        is sent that does not match the requested sensor state, the relay will
        not trigger.  The code handles this accurately, but a physical device
        will not know the difference.  So, if you click a keypadlinc button, it
        will toggle. The IOLinc may not do anything though - i.e. if the sensor
        is already in that state, it won't fire.  But the keypad button has
        toggled so now it's LED on/off is wrong.  Might be some way to "fix"
        this but it's not obvious whether or not it's a good idea or not.
        Might be nice to have an option to FORCE a controller of the IO linc
        to always be in the correct state to show the door open or closed.

    * Gotchas:
      - Clicking the set button on the device always causes the relay to trip
        and sends a broadcast message containing the state of the relay.  From
        the code, this will appear as a change in the sensor and will be
        recorded as such.
      - The simulated scene function causes basically the same result.  The
        relay will respond to the command, but the device will also send out
        a broadcast message that appears as though it is a change in the sensor
        state.  As such, scene() is not enabled for this device.
