class IOLinc(Base):
    """Insteon IOLinc relay/sensor device.

    This class can be used to model the IOLinc device which has a sensor and
    a relay.  Unfortunately, it behaves very poorly.  Unlike every other
    device, it doesn't broadcast the relay and sensor on separate groups.  So
    messages arrive from either and commands are for the relay.  There a
    number of internal mode state which change how the device behaves (see
    below for details).

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_on_off( Device, bool is_on, on_off.Mode mode ):
      Sent whenever the sensor is turned on or off.

    - signal_manual( Device, on_off.Manual mode ): Sent when the device
      starts or stops manual mode (when a button is held down or released).

    NOTES:
    Link the relay as responder to another device (controller).  Acttivate
    the controller.  Relay updates but state update is NOT emitted.

    Latching mode:
      - Click set button by hand.  Toggles relay on or off.  But it also
        emits a status update for the relay, not the sensor.  [BAD]

      - Send on command.  Relay turns on.  No state update. [GOOD]
      - Send off command.  Relay turns on.  No state update. [GOOD]

      - Send scene simulation on command.  Relay turns on.  Status update
        with ON payload sent.  [BAD]
    - Send scene simulation Off command.  Relay turns off.  Status update
        with OFF payload sent.  [BAD]

      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) on.  Relay turns on.
        No state update.  [GOOD]
      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) off.  Relay turns
        off. No state update.  [GOOD]

    Momemtary A:
      ON turns relay on, then off after delay.  OFF is ignored.  (this can be
      reversed - depends on the state of the relay when paired - i.e D1 in
      the link db responder line)

      - Click set button by hand.  Relay turns on, then off.  Emits a state
        ON update but no OFF update.  [BAD]

      - Send on.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.  No state
        update. [GOOD]
      - Send off.  Relay does nothing.  No state update. [GOOD]

      - Send scene simulation on command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with ON payload sent. [BAD]
      - Send scene simulation Off command.  Nothing happens.

      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) on.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]
      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) off.  Nothing happens.

    Momentary B:
      ON or OFF turns relay on, then off after delay.

      - Click set button by hand.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.
        Emits a state ON update but no OFF update.  [BAD]

      - Send on.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.  No state
        update. [GOOD]
      - Send off.  Relay does nothing.  No state update. [GOOD]

      - Send scene simulation on command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with ON payload sent. [BAD]
      - Send scene simulation Off command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with OFF payload sent.  [BAD]

      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) on.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]
      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) off.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]

    Momentary C:
      ON turns relay on only if sensor is in correct state (state of device
      when linked - i.e. D1 in the link db responder line).

      - Click set button by hand.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.
        Emits a state ON update but no OFF update.  [BAD]

      - Send on.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.  No state
        update.  [GOOD] - But this ignores the sensor value [BAD?]
      - Send off.  Relay does nothing.  No state update. [GOOD]

      - Send scene simulation on command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with ON payload sent.  Ignores sensor value
        [BAD]
      - Send scene simulation Off command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with ON payload sent.  Ignores sensor value
        [BAD]

      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) on.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]  Sensor value is
        handled correctly.
      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) off.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]  Sensor value is
        handled correctly.

    Not about Momentary C: If you click a keypadlinc button, it will toggle.
    The IOLinc may not do anything though - i.e. if the sensor is already in
    that state, it won't fire.  But the keypad button has toggled so now it's
    LED on/off is wrong.  Might be some way to "fix" this but it's not
    obvious whether or not it's a good idea or not.  Might be nice to have an
    option to FORCE a controller of the IO linc to always be in the correct
    state to show the door open or closed.
