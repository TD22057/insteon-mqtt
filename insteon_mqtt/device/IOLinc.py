    NOTES:

    Link the relay as responder to another device (controller).  Acttivate
    the controller.  Relay updates but state update is NOT emitted.

    Latching mode:
      - Click set button by hand.  Toggles relay on or off.  But it also
        emits a status update for the relay, not the sensor.  [BAD]

      - Send on command.  Relay turns on.  No state update. [GOOD]
      - Send off command.  Relay turns on.  No state update. [GOOD]

      - Send scene simulation on command.  Relay turns on.  Status update
        with ON payload sent.  [BAD]
    - Send scene simulation Off command.  Relay turns off.  Status update
        with OFF payload sent.  [BAD]

      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) on.  Relay turns on.
        No state update.  [GOOD]
      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) off.  Relay turns
        off. No state update.  [GOOD]

    Momemtary A:
      ON turns relay on, then off after delay.  OFF is ignored.  (this can be
      reversed - depends on the state of the relay when paired - i.e D1 in
      the link db responder line)

      - Click set button by hand.  Relay turns on, then off.  Emits a state
        ON update but no OFF update.  [BAD]

      - Send on.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.  No state
        update. [GOOD]
      - Send off.  Relay does nothing.  No state update. [GOOD]

      - Send scene simulation on command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with ON payload sent. [BAD]
      - Send scene simulation Off command.  Nothing happens.

      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) on.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]
      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) off.  Nothing happens.

    Momentary B:
      ON or OFF turns relay on, then off after delay.

      - Click set button by hand.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.
        Emits a state ON update but no OFF update.  [BAD]

      - Send on.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.  No state
        update. [GOOD]
      - Send off.  Relay does nothing.  No state update. [GOOD]

      - Send scene simulation on command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with ON payload sent. [BAD]
      - Send scene simulation Off command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with OFF payload sent.  [BAD]

      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) on.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]
      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) off.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]

    Momentary C:
      ON turns relay on only if sensor is in correct state (state of device
      when linked - i.e. D1 in the link db responder line).

      - Click set button by hand.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.
        Emits a state ON update but no OFF update.  [BAD]

      - Send on.  Relay turns on, then off after delay.  No state
        update.  [GOOD] - But this ignores the sensor value [BAD?]
      - Send off.  Relay does nothing.  No state update. [GOOD]

      - Send scene simulation on command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with ON payload sent.  Ignores sensor value
        [BAD]
      - Send scene simulation Off command.  Relay turns on, then off after
        delay.  Status update with ON payload sent.  Ignores sensor value
        [BAD]

      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) on.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]  Sensor value is
        handled correctly.
      - Click controller button (or send modem scene) off.  Relay turns on,
        then off after delay.  No state update.  [GOOD]  Sensor value is
        handled correctly.

    Not about Momentary C: If you click a keypadlinc button, it will toggle.
    The IOLinc may not do anything though - i.e. if the sensor is already in
    that state, it won't fire.  But the keypad button has toggled so now it's
    LED on/off is wrong.  Might be some way to "fix" this but it's not
    obvious whether or not it's a good idea or not.  Might be nice to have an
    option to FORCE a controller of the IO linc to always be in the correct
    state to show the door open or closed.
