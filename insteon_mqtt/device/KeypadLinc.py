class KeypadLinc(Base):
    """Insteon KeypadLinc dimmer/switch device.

    This class can be used to model a 6 or 8 button KeypadLinc with dimming
    or non-dimming functionality.  The buttons are numbered 1...8.  In the 6
    button, model, the top and bottom buttons are combined (so buttons 2 and
    7 are unused).  If the load is detached (meaning button 1 is not
    controlling the load), then a virtual button 9 is used to control the
    load.

    If a button is not controlling the load then it's on/off state only
    relates to whether or not the button LED is on or off.  For example,
    setting button group 3 to on just turns the LED on.  In many cases, a
    scene command to button 3 is what you want (to simulate pressing the
    button).

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_level_changed( Device, int level, on_off.Mode mode, str reason):
      Sent whenever the dimmer is turned on or off or changes level.  The
      level field will be in the range 0-255.  For an on/off switch, this
      will only emit 0 or 255.

    - signal_manual( Device, on_off.Manual mode, str reason ): Sent when the
      device starts or stops manual mode (when a button is held down or
      released).
