    """Insteon battery powered water leak sensor.

    A leak sensor is basically an on/off sensor except that it's batter
    powered and only awake when water is detected or the set button is
    pressed.  It will broadcast an on command for group 1 when dry and on
    command for group 2 when wet. It will also broadcast a heartbeat signal
    every 24 hours on group 4.

    The issue with a battery powered sensor is that we can't download the
    link database without the sensor being on.  You can trigger the sensor
    manually and then quickly send an MQTT command with the payload 'getdb'
    to download the database.  We also can't test to see if the local
    database is current or what the current motion state is - we can really
    only respond to the sensor when it sends out a message.

    The device will broadcast messages on the following groups:
      group 01 = wet condition
      group 02 = dry condition
      group 04 = heartbeat (0x11)

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_wet( Device, bool is_wet ): Sent when the sensor is tripped
      (is_wet=True) or cleraed (is_wet=False).

    - signal_heartbeat( Device, True ): Sent when the device has broadcast a
      heartbeat signal.
