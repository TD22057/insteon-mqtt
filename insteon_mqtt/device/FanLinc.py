    """Insteon FanLinc fan speed control device.

    This class can be used to model a FanLinc module which is used to control
    a ciling fan.  The FanLinc can be on or off and supports three speeds
    (LOW, MED, HIGH).  The FanLinc is also a dimmer switch and has the same
    signals and methods as that class (Dimmer).

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_fan_speed( Device, bool is_on, on_off.Mode mode, str reason ):
      Sent whenever the switch is turned on or off.

    - signal_manual( Device, on_off.Manual mode, str reason ): Sent when the
      device starts or stops manual mode (when a button is held down or
      released).
