    This is used for in-wall on/off outlets.  Each outlet (top and bottom) is
    an independent switch and is controlled via group 1 (top) and group2
    (bottom) inputs.

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_on_off( Device, int group, bool is_on, on_off.Mode mode ): Sent
      whenever the switch is turned on or off.  Group will be 1 for the top
      outlet and 2 for the bottom outlet.
