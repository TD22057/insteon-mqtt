class SmokeBridge(Base):
    """Insteon smoke detector bridge device.

    The smoke bridge connects wireless CO and smoke detectors into the
    Insteon network.  It will broadcast alerts for a series of conditions
    using different group numbers.  This requires pairing the modem as a
    responder for all of the groups that the smoke bridge uses.  The pair()
    method will do this automatically after the bridge is set as a responder
    to the modem (set modem, then bridge).

    Note: There is no way to ping the modem to find it's current alert state.
    If the alert is missed, there is no way to check to see what the status
    is.

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_on_off( Device, Type type, bool is_on ): Sent when the
      sensor changes state.  The type enumeration identifies the type of
      alert.
