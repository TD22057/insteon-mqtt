    This is an abstract class that provides support for the the functions used
    by responder devices. Responders are devices that can be controlled by
    the modem or some other device. BatterySensors are generally not
    responders since they are not awake to hear messages, but generally
    everything else is.

    This class is meant to be extended by other classes including DimmerBase
    so it should generally be inheritted last.
