class Base:
    """Base class for all Insteon devices.

    This class implements the required API for all devices and handles
    functions that are the same for all devices.

    The run_command() method is used for arbitrary remote commanding (via
    MQTT for example).  See the Base.cmd_map attribute for a list of methods
    tha can be called via run_command().  Derived types can extend that
    dictionary to add in their own commands to support.  Using a dictionary
    of the commands allows us to control access to which commands should be
    supported by remote access via MQTT.  If we just looked up the method
    names from the class, then anything could be called via remote message
    which isn't desirable.
