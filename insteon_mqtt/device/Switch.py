class Switch(Base):
    """Insteon on/off switch device.

    This includes any device that turns on and off like an appliance
    module or non-dimming lamp module.

    The Signal Switch.signal_active will be emitted whenever
    the device level is changed with the calling sequence (device,
    on) where on is True for on and False for off.

    Sample configuration input:

        insteon:
          devices:
            - switch:
              name: "Washing machine"
              address: 44.a3.79

    The run_command() method is used for arbitrary remote commanding
    (via MQTT for example).  The input is a dict (or keyword args)
    containing a 'cmd' key with the value as the command name and any
    additional arguments needed for the command as other key/value
    pairs. Valid commands for all devices are:

       getdb:    No arguments.  Download the PLM modem all link database
                 and save it to file.
       refresh:  No arguments.  Ping the device to get the current state and
                 see if the database is current.  Reloads the modem database
                 if needed.  This will emit the current state as a signal.
       on:       No arguments.  Turn the device on.
       off:      No arguments.  Turn the device off
       set:      Argument 'level' = 0->255 to set brightness level.  Any value
                 above 0 is treated as on.  Optional arg 'instant' with value
                 True or False to change state instantly (default=False).
