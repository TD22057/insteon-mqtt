class EZIO4O(Base):

    This class can be used to model the EZIO4O device which has 4 outputs.
    Each output has a normally close and a normally open contact. They are
    independent switches and are controlled via group 1 to group 4 inputs.

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_on_off( Device, int group, bool is_on, on_off.Mode mode, str
                     reason ): Sent whenever an output is turned on or off.
                     Group will be 1 to 4 matching the corresponding device
