__doc__ = """Insteon device classes.

Devices are physical entities in the Insteon system.  They can be
commanded via MQTT and are responsible for responding to messages
received over the network with their address.

Each device stores a scene (all link) database that matches the
database stored on the physical device.  This insures that when a
scene is activated, the device can notify every other device in the
scene to update to insure that the state of each device is consistent
with the state of the physical device.  This device is stored locally
on disk and must be manually refreshed if you change the pairings of
the devices with physical buttons.

Each device has a pair() method that can be used to correctly link it
to the PLM modem.  Devices must be paired as responders to the modem
first (hold the modem set button, then the device.
