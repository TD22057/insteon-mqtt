class Dimmer(Base):
    """Insteon dimmer device.

    This class can be used to model any device that acts like a dimmer
    including wall switches, lamp modules, and some remotes.

    State changes are communicated by emitting signals.  Other classes can
    connect to these signals to perform an action when a change is made to
    the device (like sending MQTT messages).  Supported signals are:

    - signal_level_changed( Device, int level, on_off.Mode mode, str reason ):
      Sent whenever the dimmer is turned on or off or changes level.  The
      level field will be in the range 0-255.

    - signal_manual( Device, on_off.Manual mode, str reason ): Sent when the
      device starts or stops manual mode (when a button is held down or
      released).
