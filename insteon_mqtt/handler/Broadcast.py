class Broadcast(Base):
    """Broadcast message handler.

    Broadcast messages are sent when a device is triggered manually like
    pushing a light switch or a motion sensor.  The message is an all link
    broadcast which says 'address AA.BB.CC activate group DD' and any device
    in that is a responder to that group will activate.

    The message sequence is an ALL_LINK_BROADCAST which we can get the device
    address and group from.  Then an ALL_LINK_CLEANUP is sent.  Both messages
    can be used to trigger the scene but we'll only do that once (so the 2nd
    message gets ignored).  So if we get the broadcast, the cleanup is
    ignored.

    This handler will call device.handle_broadcast(msg) for the device that
    sends the message.

    NOTE: This handler is designed to always be active - it never returns
    FINISHED.
