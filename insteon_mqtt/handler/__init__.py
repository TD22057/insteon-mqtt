__doc__ = """Message handler classes.

Message handlers are classes that respond to messages read from the PLM
modem.  Handlers are responsible for figuring out what to do with the read
message and telling the Protocol class if that's the last expected message in
a squence or not.

Inbound messages can be:

1) Replies from commands we send to the modem.  For a std msg (8 bytes),
   we'll get a echo reply w/ ACK/NAK (9 bytes).  If this fails, we'll get a 2
   byte NAK.  After the ACK, we'll probably also get further messages in.  If
   we don't wait for these and continue writing messages, the modem won't
   send them (but will ACK them).  So once we send a message, we need to know
   what the expected reply is going to be and wait for that.

2) inbound msg from modem when a device triggers and sends a message to the
   modem.  This will be an 11 byte std msg.

3) Device database reading.  Reading remote db's involves sending one
   command, getting an ACK, then reading a series of messages (1 per db
   entry) until we get a final message which ends the sequence.
