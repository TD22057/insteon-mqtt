class ModemScene(Base):
    """Modem scene activation handler.

    This handles the callbacks when simulated modem scene is sent using the
    OutModemScene message.  Calls modem.handle_scene when complete.

    Modem scene controls are complicated things.  Their main feature is that
    from an end-user's perspective and if the message is received correctly
    all devices seem to change instananeously and at once.

    However, because of the complexity of the task the modem is asked to
    perform, it seems that if the modem is interrupted by any extraneous
    Insteon message while performing the scene command, it may somewhat lose
    its mind.

    It appears the the Modem still continues to process everything correctly
    but the messages it reports to the host can appear wrong.  Such as wrong
    groups reported, CLEANUP_NAKs that are wrong, wrong InpAllLinkFailure
    reports and even a wrong or premature InpAllLinkStatus NAK.

    We can't do anything with these messages when they arrive, since we don't
    know what they should have meant.  However, if we extend the time_out each
    time we receive one of these garbled messages, we eventually will receive
    a correct InpAllLinkStatus ACK.  To the extent we can identify any of
    these messages as meant for this handler, we report them to the user for
    potential debugging.
