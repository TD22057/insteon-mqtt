class Base:
    """Protocol message handler API.

    This class defines the handler API and implements some basic features
    that all the handlers use like a time out and finished callback.

    Time outs: The Protocol class will call is_expired() at a reasonable
    interval to see if the time out has been reached.  Handlers can use this
    to expire (normal behavior), send addition messages, or whatever custom
    time out behavior they want.  The Protocol will update_expire_time()
    whenever message traffic is received by this handler so that a series of
    messages won't cause the time out to trigger.  If num_retry is set, then
    a message will be retried that many times after a time out.

    Callbacks: most handlers have a "when finished" callback which is run
    when the message sequence is finished.  For convenience, this on_done
    callback is stored in the base class.  The API for the callback is
    always:
       on_done( bool success, str message, data )

          num_retry (int):  The number of times to retry the message if the
