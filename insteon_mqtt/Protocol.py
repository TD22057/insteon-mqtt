class Protocol:
    """Insteon PLM protocol processing class.

    This class processes the byte stream that is being read from and written
    to the Insteon PLM modem.  It connects to a network/Serial link class
    which handles the actual reading and writing.

    For input, this class connects to the network.Serial class signals for
    data being read.  When data is read, it's added to a bytearray and then
    we search for 0x02 bytes which are the start of an Insteon message.
    After that, we look at the message type code byte and search for a
    message handler to handle the class.  There can be a set of read handlers
    that are always active for handling messages.

    If a message was written out, it also registers a handler with the
    message to write.  That write handler is checked first whenever a message
    comes back in until all the expected replies come in.  Then the write
    handler is removed and the next message in the write queue is sent.

    The types of messages we expected are:

    1) Replies from commands we send to the modem.  For a standard message (8
       bytes), we'll get a echo reply w/ ACK/NAK (9 bytes).  If this fails,
       we'll get a 2 byte NAK.  After the ACK, we'll probably also get
       further messages in.  If we don't wait for these and continue writing
       messages, the modem won't send them (but will ACK them).  So once we
       send a message, we need to know what the expected reply is going to be
       and wait for that.

    2) Inbound messages from modem when a device triggers and sends a message
       to the modem.  This will be an 11 byte standard message that's a
       broadcast or broadcast cleanup type message.

    3) Device database reading.  Reading remote db's from a device involves
       sending one command, getting an ACK, then reading a series of messages
       (1 per db entry) until we get a final message which ends the sequence.
