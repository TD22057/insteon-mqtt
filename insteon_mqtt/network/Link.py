    """Network link (file, socket, etc) to monitor for reading and writing.

    A Link represents a connection to a device that needs to be watched for
    reading and writing events.  It works with a poll.Manager event loop to
    allow efficient reading and writing of network (or network like) based
    connections.

    The link reports to the manager via signals when there is data to write
    (or not) and when the link is closing.  The manager will call
    read_from_link() and write_to_link() when the link can actually perform
    those actions.
