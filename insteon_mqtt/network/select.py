    This class implements a networking event loop (poll or select) using the
    select.select system (so it is supported on Windows).

    Network connections (or files, sockets, etc) should inherit from the Link
    class which will manage the communication with this class and handle
    reading and writing callbacks.

    If a link reports that it is not connected yet (or it drops the
    connection later), the manager will poll the link at Manager.min_time_out
    to try and reconnect it if Link.retry_connect_dt() is active.

    Create the manager, then the links, then call poll() to start the loop.
