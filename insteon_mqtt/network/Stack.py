    """A Fake Network Interface for Queueing and 'Asynchronously' Running
    Functional Calls

    This is a polling only network "link".  Unlike regular links that do read
    and write operations when they report they are ready, this class is
    designed to only be polled during the event loop.

    This is like a network link for reading and writing but  that is handled
    my the network manager.  But in reality it is just a wrapper for inserting
    function calls into the network loop.  This allows long functional calls
    to be broken up into multiple sub calls that can be called on seperate
    iterations of the main loop.

    This isn't true asynchronous functionality, but it prevents the main loop
    from halting for too long.

    At the moment, and as best I can currently envision, this class is only
    necessary for the import_scenes functionality.  I can't imagine any other
    process that would require such complex and long running functions.
