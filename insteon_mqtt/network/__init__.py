__doc__ = """Network manage package

This package handles network and serial connections.  It uses select/poll
systems to manage multiple connections and read data notifications are
handled via the Signal class (loose coupling).

The network manager supports delayed connections (so remote hosts don't have
to be available right away) and automatic reconnections if links get closed
for maximum robustness.
