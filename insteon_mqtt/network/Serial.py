    This class reads and writes to a serial connection using the

    network manager class to allow for multiple connections and other
    network activity to occur.

    Data reading and writing is handled via the Signal clsas.  When
    data is read, Serial.signal_read(Serial, bytes) will be emitted
    with the link and the data that was read.  When data is
    successfully written, Serial.signal_write(Serial, bytes) will be
    called with the data that was written.

    Input fields can be set via the constructor or by loading a
    configuration file (see load_config for details).
