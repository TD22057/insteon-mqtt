    # Input on/off command.  This forces the relay on/off and ignores the
    # momentary-C sensor setting.  Use this to force the relay to respond.
    # If momentary mode is active, it will turn off after the delay.  The
    # output of passing the payload through the template must match the
    # following:
    #   { "cmd" : 'on'/'off' }
    # Available variables for templating are:
    #   value = the input payload
    #   json = the input payload converted to json.  Use json.VAR to extract
    #          a variable from a json payload.

    # Scene on/off command.  This triggers the IOLinc as if it were a
    # responder to a scene command and is the "correct" way to trigger the
    # IOLinc relay in that it respects the momentary settings.  The inputs
    # are the same as those for the on_off topic and payload.
