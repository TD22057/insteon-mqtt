# Scenes Definition File
#
# Overview
# This file allows users to define scenes that should exist on their network.
# This enables the sync links functions to work.  A user is not
# required to have a scenes file, but it can make the process of maintianing
# a complex network of links easier by enabling the user to specify links in
# a single location rather than individually adding links to each device by
# hand.
#
# Format
# The scenes are defined as a yaml file.  You can find the specifications for
# a yaml file online.
#
# A note about comments. Anything on a line after a # is treated as a comment.
# These comments will remain unaltered with the exception of when import-scenes
# is run.  Import-scenes will attempt to keep your comments, but this is not
# always possible.  As such:
#
#     !!It is best to backup your scenes file before running import-scenes!!
#
# Individual Scene Format
# Below are some examples of how a scene may be defined.  Each scene is an item
# in a list.  Each scene item contains a dictionary of the following keys:
# name (string)- [optional] If specified and the modem is defined as a
#        controller, this name will be attached to the modem scene number.
#        Otherwise this is ignored.
# responders (list) - Each list item defines a scene device that acts as a
#        responder in this scene. (more on scene device definitions this below)
# controllers (list) - Each list item defines a scene device that acts as a
#        controller in this scene. (more on scene device definitions this below)
#
# Scene Device Format
# A scene device can be defined in a number of ways:
# - As a string of the device address such as aa.bbb.cc
# - As a string of the device name as specified in the config file
# - As a dict, where the key is the device name or address and the value is
#      the group as an int
# - As a dict, where the key is the device name or address and the value is
#      a dict containing additional device attributes including by default:
#              group, data_1, data_2, data_3
#      the value of each is an int of the byte value for that attribute.
#      Additionally, specific devices may also include attributes such as:
#              ramp_rate (float .1 - 540.0) - How quickly the light should turn
#                        on or off in seconds
#              on_level (float 0.0 - 100.0) - The brightness level of on
#                        expressed as a percentage
# Any device attribute that is unspecified will be set to the default value
# the following are the current defaults:
#    group = 1, on_level = 100, ramp_rate = .1
#
# Generally, controller links do not have any attributes with the exception of
# a group number for multigrouped devices (keypadlinc, remotes, modem).
#
# Modem Controller Entries (Modem Scenes or Virtual Scenes)
# Each modem scene needs to have its own unique group number from 2-253.  You
# do not need to specify this group number.  Simply specify the modem as a
# a controller, and the rest will be handled for you.  A group number will be
# added for you automatically from the pool of unused numbers after the Scenes
# file is processed the first time.  You can see these numbers by opening the
# scenes file after it has been processed.  However, if you want to add
# a group number manually you can, but be warned if the group numbers collide
# bad things will happen.
#
# Again, YOU ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from making entries that look like:
# - modem: 21
# - modem:
#     group: 21
#
# Instead just do:
# - modem
#
# Join and Pair Links
# Links that are generated by the 'join' command (Modem:1->Device) or the 'pair'
# command (Device->Modem) will not and need not appear in the scenes file.
# These links are handled entirely by the 'pair' and 'join' commands and they
# will be ignored and have no effect if you try to define them in here.
